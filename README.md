# 2-VR-Applications
A simple FPS shooting game and a gallery application.Both are developed for CardBoard,using Unity3D Engine.My first step in VR developing.

Just two simple demos,one is a shootinggame,the other is a gallary app;

1,In the shooting game,u'll walk towards your eye's direction,and shoot when you touch the screen.

2,In the gallary app,u press to walk and press again to stop,and if u r close to the paintings,u'll hear voices introducing the pictures;
